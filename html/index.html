      <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet.</p>
    
      <p>Which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it.</p>

        <p>The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round.</p>
